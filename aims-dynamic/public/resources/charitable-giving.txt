Charitable Giving & DAFs

- A donor‑advised fund (DAF) is a giving account established at a public charity. You make contributions of cash or appreciated assets, receive an immediate tax deduction, and then recommend grants to your favorite charities over time【230157262629390†L79-L90】.
- Contributions to a DAF are irrevocable but may be invested and grow tax‑free. Donors can suggest grants whenever they like, allowing them to bunch deductions in one year while distributing gifts over future years【230157262629390†L140-L156】.
- DAFs offer an immediate income tax deduction, potential to avoid capital gains tax when you donate appreciated assets, tax‑free growth of invested contributions, simplified administration, the option for anonymity, and the ability to leave a charitable legacy by naming successors or charitable beneficiaries【230157262629390†L189-L208】.
- Charitable trusts such as CRTs and CLTs can provide income streams and tax benefits but require legal setup and administration. DAFs offer a simpler, more flexible way to support multiple charities over time.
