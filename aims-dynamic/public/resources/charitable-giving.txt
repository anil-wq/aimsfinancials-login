Charitable Giving & DAFs

- **Donor‑advised funds (DAFs)** are giving accounts established at public charities. You contribute cash or appreciated assets, receive an immediate income tax deduction and can recommend grants to your favorite charities over time. Contributions are irrevocable but may be invested and grow tax‑free while you decide where to give.

- **How DAFs work:** You can bunch several years of charitable deductions into one tax year by making a large contribution to a DAF and then recommend grants over time. DAF sponsors handle recordkeeping and grant administration, and you may remain anonymous if desired. Donated securities can avoid capital gains tax, enhancing the amount available for charity.

- **Benefits of DAFs:** Immediate tax deduction, potential to avoid capital gains tax, tax‑free growth of invested contributions, simplified administration and the ability to name successors so that charitable giving can continue for future generations.

- **Drawbacks of DAFs and fees:** Donors must give up legal control; the sponsoring organization has the final say on grants; there is no requirement for the fund to distribute money to charities, delaying impact; and administrative and investment fees can reduce the value of the account. In rare cases, mismanagement or bankruptcy of a sponsor may jeopardize contributions.

- **Charitable trusts vs. DAFs:** Charitable trusts such as charitable remainder trusts (CRTs) and charitable lead trusts (CLTs) can provide income streams and significant tax benefits but are irrevocable, require legal setup and ongoing administration and reduce flexibility compared with DAFs. A DAF is a simpler, more flexible option for charitable giving across multiple causes.
