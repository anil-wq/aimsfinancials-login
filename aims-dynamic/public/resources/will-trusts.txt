Wills & Trusts

- **Wills vs. trusts:** A last will and testament directs how your assets are distributed after death but must go through probate, which is public and can be lengthy and costly. Trusts allow you to transfer ownership of assets to a trustee for the benefit of beneficiaries and can avoid probate.

- **Living revocable trust:** A revocable living trust lets you retitle assets into the trust during your lifetime while maintaining control. It avoids probate, becomes irrevocable at death and allows you to set conditions for when beneficiaries receive distributions. Drawbacks include the time and expense of retitling assets, lack of direct tax benefits and no protection from creditors.

- **Testamentary trust:** Created under your will, a testamentary trust springs to life only after you die. It is irrevocable at that point and can hold life insurance proceeds or other property for minor beneficiaries until they reach specified ages or milestones. Because the trust is established by your will, your estate still must go through probate, and the trust terms cannot be changed after your death.

- **Special needs trust:** A special needs trust helps a disabled beneficiary by providing funds for supplemental expenses without jeopardizing eligibility for government benefits such as Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income. These trusts must be carefully drafted and administered to comply with strict rules; misuse of funds could disqualify the beneficiary from benefits.

- **Irrevocable vs. revocable trusts:** Irrevocable trusts remove assets from your taxable estate and protect them from creditors but cannot easily be changed or revoked, meaning you give up control over the assets once transferred. Revocable trusts offer flexibility during your lifetime but do not provide the same level of asset protection or tax benefits.

- **Funding and updating:** Estate planning documents should be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect changes in your family, assets and tax laws. Failing to properly fund a trust or update beneficiary designations can result in assets passing through probate or unintended distributions.
