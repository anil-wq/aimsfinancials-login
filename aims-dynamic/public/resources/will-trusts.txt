Wills & Trusts

- Wills direct how your assets are distributed after death but must go through probate, which can be lengthy and public.
- A living revocable trust lets you retitle assets into the trust during your lifetime while maintaining control. It avoids probate, becomes irrevocable at death, and allows you to set conditions for when beneficiaries receive distributions【881872402105417†L124-L148】.
- Testamentary trusts are created under your will and spring to life only after you die. They are irrevocable at that point and can hold life insurance proceeds or other property for minor beneficiaries until they reach specified ages or milestones【881872402105417†L155-L175】.
- Special needs trusts help disabled beneficiaries by providing funds for supplemental expenses without jeopardizing their eligibility for government benefits such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income【881872402105417†L177-L184】.
- Irrevocable trusts remove assets from your taxable estate and protect them from creditors but cannot easily be changed or revoked. Revocable trusts offer flexibility during your lifetime but do not provide the same level of asset protection.
- Estate documents should be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect changes in your family situation, assets, and tax laws.
