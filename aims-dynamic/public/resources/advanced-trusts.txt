Advanced Trusts

- **Charitable remainder trust (CRT):** A CRT allows you to transfer appreciated assets into an irrevocable trust, avoid immediate capital gains tax on their sale, and receive an income stream for life or a set term. You receive a charitable tax deduction based on the present value of the remainder interest, and whatever remains at the end goes to the charity of your choice. CRTs involve legal and administrative costs and require you to give up control of the assets.

- **Charitable lead trust (CLT):** A CLT provides an income stream to a designated charity for a period of time. When the term ends, the remaining assets revert to you or your heirs, potentially reducing estate taxes. CLTs are irrevocable and complex to administer, and you must be comfortable parting with control of the assets during the trust term.

- **Irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT):** An ILIT owns a life insurance policy outside your estate. Premiums you contribute are considered gifts, and the death benefit passes to beneficiaries estate‑tax free while shielding the proceeds from creditors. Because the trust is irrevocable, you cannot change the policy or access its cash value after transfer, and annual gifts must be managed properly to avoid gift‑tax issues.

- **Asset protection trust:** Asset protection trusts are irrevocable arrangements established under the laws of specific jurisdictions to shield assets from future creditors. They typically require professional administration and strict compliance with state statutes; creditors or courts may challenge transfers if they believe the trust was created to defraud creditors.

- **Lifetime access trust (spousal lifetime access trust):** A lifetime access trust allows your spouse limited access to trust assets during his or her lifetime while preserving wealth for children. These trusts must be structured carefully to avoid inclusion in the surviving spouse’s taxable estate and rely on the trustee’s discretion to balance the needs of the spouse and heirs.

- **A‑B trust (marital and credit shelter trust):** An A‑B trust splits property into two trusts after the first spouse dies: a marital trust for the surviving spouse and a credit shelter trust for heirs. This strategy maximizes federal estate tax exemptions and protects beneficiaries, but it introduces complexity and requires careful funding and ongoing administration.
