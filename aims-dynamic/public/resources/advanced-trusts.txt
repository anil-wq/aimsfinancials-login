Advanced Trusts

- A charitable remainder trust (CRT) lets you transfer appreciated assets to the trust, avoid immediate capital gains tax on their sale, receive a stream of income for life or for a set term, and benefit from a charitable tax deduction. At the end of the term, the remaining assets go to the charity you choose【881872402105417†L284-L305】.
- A charitable lead trust (CLT) provides an income stream to a designated charity for a period of time. When the term ends, the remaining assets revert to you or your heirs, potentially reducing estate taxes【881872402105417†L284-L305】.
- An irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) owns a life insurance policy outside your estate. Premiums you contribute are considered gifts, and the death benefit passes to beneficiaries estate‑tax free while shielding the proceeds from creditors【881872402105417†L193-L219】.
- Asset protection trusts are irrevocable arrangements that shield assets from future creditors. They are permitted in a limited number of jurisdictions and typically require professional administration【881872402105417†L221-L231】.
- A lifetime access trust (also known as a spousal lifetime access trust) allows your spouse limited access to trust assets during his or her lifetime. This structure preserves wealth for children while giving your spouse flexibility【881872402105417†L238-L253】.
- An A‑B trust divides property into two trusts after the first spouse dies—a marital trust for the surviving spouse and a credit shelter trust for heirs. This arrangement can maximize estate tax exemptions and protect beneficiaries【881872402105417†L255-L260】.
