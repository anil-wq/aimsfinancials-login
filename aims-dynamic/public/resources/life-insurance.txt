Life Insurance

Life insurance is a cornerstone of many high‑net‑worth financial plans. It provides a tax‑free death benefit and, in the case of permanent policies, can build cash value that grows tax‑deferred. Below is an overview of the main types of life insurance, how each can be used, and considerations for affluent individuals.

- **Term life insurance:** Provides affordable coverage for a specific period (e.g., 10, 20 or 30 years). It pays a tax‑free death benefit if the insured dies during the term, making it ideal for temporary needs such as mortgage protection or income replacement. There is no cash value, so the policy expires if you outlive the term and may need to be renewed at higher premiums.

- **Whole life insurance:** Offers permanent coverage with guaranteed premiums, a guaranteed death benefit and a cash value component that grows at a predetermined rate. Policyholders can borrow against the cash value on a tax‑advantaged basis, and participating policies may pay dividends. The downside is that whole life premiums are much higher than term, and the internal rate of return may be lower than other investments.

- **Universal life insurance:** Provides lifelong protection with flexible premiums and adjustable death benefits. Standard universal life policies credit a guaranteed interest rate; indexed universal life (IUL) ties cash value growth to a stock index with caps and floors; and variable universal life (VUL) invests the cash value in mutual fund‑like subaccounts. These policies can offer higher returns but involve higher fees, market risk and complexity. If the cash value underperforms, additional premium may be needed to keep the policy in force.

- **Survivorship policies:** Insure two people (usually spouses) and pay the death benefit after both have passed. They are commonly used to create liquidity for estate taxes and inheritance equalization. Premiums can be lower than buying two individual permanent policies, but the policy pays nothing at the first death.

- **Estate liquidity and planning:** High‑net‑worth individuals often use life insurance to provide cash for estate taxes so that heirs do not have to sell illiquid assets such as real estate or a family business. Life insurance can equalize inheritances when passing different types of assets to multiple beneficiaries and can fund buy‑sell agreements or key‑person coverage for private companies.

- **Advanced strategies:** Strategies for affluent clients include pairing a permanent policy with an irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) to remove the policy from the taxable estate, using survivorship policies for estate tax planning, and leveraging cash value via tax‑free loans to supplement retirement income. Premium financing allows you to borrow funds to pay large premiums, freeing up capital for other investments; however, it carries interest rate risk and collateral requirements.

- **Charitable planning:** Life insurance can be donated to a charity, either by naming the charity as beneficiary or by transferring ownership of the policy for an immediate income‑tax deduction. A policy can also be placed in a charitable remainder trust to provide income to donors and leave a charitable gift at death. These strategies require careful structuring and may reduce the estate passed to heirs.

- **Risks and drawbacks:** Permanent life insurance policies are complex and expensive. Costs include high premiums, fees, and surrender charges. Investment‑linked policies such as IUL and VUL expose you to market risk and may underperform expectations. Policy loans reduce the death benefit if not repaid. Establishing an ILIT or premium financing arrangement requires ongoing administration and adherence to tax rules. Always consult with qualified advisors to determine whether a given life insurance strategy fits your objectives and risk tolerance.
