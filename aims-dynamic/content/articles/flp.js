    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>An FLP is a business entity typically used to hold a family’s business, real estate or investment assets. Parents or senior family members serve as general partners, maintaining control over management, while limited partnership interests are gifted or sold to children or trusts at discounted values.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Estate and gift tax planning for family businesses or concentrated asset portfolios.</li>
      <li>Coordinating family governance and succession planning by consolidating assets under one entity.</li>
      <li>Providing a vehicle for gradual transfer of wealth while retaining operational control.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Valuation discounts (lack of control and marketability) reduce gift and estate tax costs on transferred limited partnership interests.</li>
      <li>Centralized management allows experienced family members to oversee investments and operations.</li>
      <li>Limited partners enjoy liability protection from partnership debts and lawsuits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Complex and costly to establish; requires ongoing accounting, appraisals and adherence to business formalities.</li>
      <li>General partners have unlimited personal liability for partnership obligations.</li>
      <li>IRS scrutiny—discounts must be substantiated, and the FLP must operate as a bona fide business.</li>
      <li>Potential for family disputes over control and distributions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Transferring family business interests to the next generation while retaining voting control.</li>
      <li>Combining FLPs with trusts (e.g., GRATs, IDGTs) to leverage valuation discounts and freeze estate values.</li>
      <li>Providing a platform for educating heirs about investing and stewardship through limited partnership ownership.</li>
    </ul>
