    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>
      Cash value life insurance refers to permanent policies that include an
      investment or savings component in addition to a death benefit. Part of
      your premium builds cash value that grows tax deferred and can be
      accessed through loans or withdrawals. Unlike term insurance, coverage
      lasts your entire life as long as premiums are paid.
    </p>

    <h3>Main types</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Whole life.</strong> Provides lifetime coverage with a fixed
        premium and guaranteed minimum cash value growth. Dividends may
        increase cash value or reduce premiums【822975951468708†L965-L974】.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Universal life.</strong> Offers flexible premiums and a
        minimum guaranteed interest rate; excess premium grows in a separate
        account. You can increase or decrease the death benefit and adjust
        contributions【822975951468708†L977-L987】.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Variable life.</strong> Combines permanent insurance with
        investment subaccounts similar to mutual funds; cash value and death
        benefit vary with market performance. The policyholder bears the
        investment risk【822975951468708†L1000-L1011】.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Indexed universal life (IUL).</strong> Credits interest based
        on the performance of an equity index subject to caps and floors;
        provides downside protection and upside potential.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Variable universal life (VUL).</strong> A hybrid offering
        flexible premiums and investment subaccounts for growth potential.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Builds cash value you can borrow against or withdraw, providing
        supplemental funds for emergencies or opportunities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tax‑deferred accumulation and potential for tax‑free loans or
        withdrawals if structured properly【822975951468708†L989-L997】.
      </li>
      <li>
        Permanent death benefit can support estate liquidity and legacy goals.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Higher premiums than term life; long‑term commitment is required to
        realize benefits.
      </li>
      <li>
        Policy loans or withdrawals reduce the death benefit and may incur
        taxes if the policy lapses【822975951468708†L989-L997】.
      </li>
      <li>
        Investment risk in variable policies is borne by the policyholder; caps
        in indexed policies may limit upside.
      </li>
    </ul>
