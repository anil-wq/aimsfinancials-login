    <h2>Limited Partnership (LP)</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>An LP separates control (general partner) from passive investors (limited partners). It is often used to centralize management while transferring economic interests.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>LPs (including Family Limited Partnerships) allow control retention while gifting limited partnership interests to heirs for estate planning.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Control retained by GP</li><li>Potential valuation discounts for gift tax planning</li><li>Flexibility in distribution structures</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>General partner still faces liability unless GP is an entity</li><li>IRS scrutiny on valuation discounts if abused</li><li>Ongoing governance complexity</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>LPs can be powerful estate- and succession-planning tools; improper use can invite audits or litigation.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>HNW families use FLP/LP to transfer interests to trusts while preserving decision-making in a GP or entity they control</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>LP structures should be paired with operating agreements, buy-sell terms, and trustee mechanisms to preserve control across generations.</p>
