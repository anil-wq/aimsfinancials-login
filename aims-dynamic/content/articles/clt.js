    <h2>Charitable Lead Trust (CLT)</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A split-interest trust paying a fixed (CLAT) or variable (CLUT) amount to charity for a term; remainder returns to family.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>Moves wealth to heirs at potentially reduced gift tax cost while satisfying near-term charitable goals.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Gift tax leverage when §7520 rate conditions favorable</li><li>Keeps assets in family after term</li><li>Flexible term/payout design</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No income tax deduction for non-grantor CLT at funding</li><li>Complex administration and investment management</li><li>Performance risk affects family remainder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>CLTs can satisfy philanthropic intent and wealth transfer. Without CLTs, gifts to charity may be less leveraged for estate planning.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>HNW families with sizable charitable budgets who want remainder to heirs</li><li>Used with appreciating assets and favorable interest rates</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>Coordinate grantor vs non-grantor design, payout sizing, and investment strategy for target remainder outcomes.</p>
