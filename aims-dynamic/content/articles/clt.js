    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A CLT is an irrevocable trust that makes fixed annual payments to one or more charities for a specified term. After the term ends, the remaining trust assets transfer to the grantor or the grantor’s beneficiaries.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>For donors who want to support charities during their lifetime while ultimately transferring assets to heirs at a reduced gift or estate tax cost.</li>
      <li>Useful in low interest‑rate environments, where the present value of the charitable lead payments is high relative to the remainder.</li>
      <li>Fulfills philanthropic goals while retaining wealth within the family.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Provides an upfront gift or estate tax deduction based on the present value of the charity’s income interest.</li>
      <li>Allows current charitable giving without permanently relinquishing principal to charity.</li>
      <li>Any appreciation beyond the IRS discount rate accrues to heirs with reduced transfer tax.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Irrevocable; the grantor cannot reclaim the assets or change the charitable beneficiary once the trust is set up.</li>
      <li>The trust’s investment earnings are taxed to the grantor (in a grantor CLT), which can create cash‑flow obligations.</li>
      <li>Complexity and administrative costs, including annual valuation and potential state registration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Structured charitable giving by high‑net‑worth individuals who wish to support nonprofits over a term and then pass remaining assets to heirs.</li>
      <li>Leveraging low Section 7520 rates to transfer appreciating assets to heirs at a reduced gift value.</li>
      <li>Can be paired with an IDGT or other trust to maximize tax efficiency and control the eventual distribution of assets.</li>
    </ul>
