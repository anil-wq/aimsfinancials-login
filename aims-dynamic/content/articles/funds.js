    <h2>ETFs & Mutual Funds</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>Pooled investment vehicles offering diversified exposure across asset classes. Mutual funds trade once per day; ETFs trade intraday like stocks.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Diversification and professional management</li><li>Broad exposure with low minimums</li><li>ETFs can be tax-efficient with in-kind redemptions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Managed fund fees and possible capital gains distributions</li><li>Tracking error vs benchmark for some ETFs</li><li>Behavioral risks (overtrading ETFs)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>Without fund vehicles, investors may be underdiversified and pay higher costs for direct holdings.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Core-satellite portfolio design, factor tilts, tax-loss harvesting with paired ETFs</li>
    </ul>
