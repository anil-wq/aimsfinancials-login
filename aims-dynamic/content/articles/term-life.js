    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>Term life provides pure death‑benefit coverage for a specified period, typically 10 to 30 years. It has no cash value and ends when the term expires unless renewed or converted.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Affordable income replacement during working years or while children are dependent.</li>
      <li>Used in business contexts for key‑person protection or buy–sell agreements.</li>
      <li>Acts as a bridge to permanent coverage when liquidity or insurability is expected later in life.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lowest cost per dollar of death benefit; straightforward to compare across carriers.</li>
      <li>Convertible options allow upgrading to permanent coverage without new medical underwriting, within a set window.</li>
      <li>Simple structure—premiums purchase pure protection with no market or interest‑crediting assumptions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Coverage expires; renewal after the term can be costly or unavailable if health declines.</li>
      <li>No cash value accumulation or policy‑loan features to provide liquidity.</li>
      <li>Requires proactive planning to convert or replace the policy before it ends.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Often layered with permanent policies to balance cost and estate liquidity needs.</li>
      <li>Can be owned by an irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) to remove the death benefit from the taxable estate.</li>
    </ul>
