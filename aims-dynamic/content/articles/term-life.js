    <h2>Term Life Insurance</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>Term life insurance provides pure death benefit protection for a fixed term (e.g., 10, 15, 20, 30 years). It has no cash value and typically the lowest cost per dollar of coverage.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>People use term life to replace income, cover mortgages, or provide liquidity in the event of premature death during high-earning years.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Low upfront cost</li><li>Simplicity and predictability</li><li>Easily convertible to some permanent products (in some plans)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No cash value accumulation</li><li>Coverage ends at term expiry unless renewed (renewals become very expensive)</li><li>Less useful for permanent estate planning by itself</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>Without term coverage, a family may face immediate liquidity shortfalls to pay debts, mortgages, or provide for surviving dependents.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Buy term for mortgage/education coverage; pair with permanent policies for estate liquidity</li><li>Executive may use a term layer to cover a key-person or policy buy-sell obligations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>Term is not an estate planning vehicle; it provides liquidity but does not transfer wealth.</p>
