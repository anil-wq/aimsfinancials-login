    <h2>Term Life Insurance</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>Term life insurance provides pure death benefit protection for a fixed term (e.g., 10â€“30 years). No cash value.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>Replaces income, covers debts and obligations during high-earning years.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lowest cost per dollar of coverage</li><li>Simple and predictable</li><li>Convertible options in some contracts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No cash value</li><li>Becomes expensive to renew at older ages</li><li>Not permanent coverage</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>Without term coverage, families may face immediate liquidity gaps for debts, living expenses and education funding.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Layer term to match liabilities (mortgage, RSU cliffs)</li><li>Key-person coverage for founders/executives</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>Primarily a liquidity tool; not an estate tax solution by itself.</p>
