    <h2>Healthcare Power of Attorney</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A healthcare POA (medical proxy) designates a person to make medical decisions if you are unable to express preferences.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>It ensures your healthcare preferences are followed and relieves family members from making ad-hoc decisions.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensures decisions align with your wishes</li><li>Simplifies interactions with care providers</li><li>Can be paired with advance directives/living wills</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Emotional burden on agent if not prepared</li><li>State-specific forms and requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>Without a healthcare POA, families may face uncertainty and legal delays in making critical medical decisions.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>HNW families should pair healthcare POA with living wills and estate plans to ensure holistic incapacity planning</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>Healthcare POA is a core non-tax document that preserves autonomy and reduces conflict during incapacity.</p>
