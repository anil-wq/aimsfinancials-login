    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>An ILIT is an irrevocable trust that owns and controls life insurance policies. By removing ownership from the insured’s estate, the death benefit avoids estate tax and can be managed by a trustee for the beneficiaries’ benefit.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Estate tax planning where large insurance proceeds would otherwise push an estate above exemption limits.</li>
      <li>Structured distributions to heirs to prevent mismanagement or creditor issues.</li>
      <li>Asset protection and divorce shielding when the trust is properly drafted and funded.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Removes life insurance proceeds from the taxable estate, potentially saving significant estate taxes.</li>
      <li>Trustee controls premiums, Crummey notices and distribution terms to protect beneficiaries.</li>
      <li>Can protect death benefit from creditors and divorcing spouses (jurisdiction dependent).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Irrevocable—policy ownership and terms cannot be changed once transferred; mistakes cannot be undone.</li>
      <li>Requires diligent administration, including delivery of Crummey notices and timely premium payments.</li>
      <li>Premium gifts use annual gift tax exclusion or lifetime exemption; improper funding risks inclusion in estate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Combined with whole life, IUL, VUL or PPLI policies to provide estate liquidity and shelter death benefits.</li>
      <li>Used with premium financing or split‑dollar arrangements to leverage outside collateral while keeping the policy proceeds outside the estate.</li>
      <li>Can be structured as a dynasty trust to provide multigenerational benefits without estate tax inclusion.</li>
    </ul>
