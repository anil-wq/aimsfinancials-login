    <h2>Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT)</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A trust designed to own life insurance so that death benefits are excluded from the insured’s taxable estate.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>Provides estate liquidity for taxes and expenses without increasing estate size; separates ownership from the insured.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Removes policy proceeds from taxable estate</li><li>Provides liquidity timed to death</li><li>Can control distributions and beneficiaries</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Loss of control over the policy once transferred</li><li>Crummey powers and admin to qualify gifts may be required</li><li>Premium funding logistics (split gifts)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>With an ILIT, death benefits can pass estate- and GST-efficiently. Without it, large policies may swell the taxable estate.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>HNW families funding large permanent policies to create estate liquidity</li><li>Paired with GRAT/IDGT sales to balance tax and liquidity needs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>Coordinate trustee, Crummey notices, and GST exemption allocation; consider state premium taxes and trustee location.</p>
