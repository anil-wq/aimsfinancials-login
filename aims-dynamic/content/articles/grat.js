    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A GRAT is an irrevocable trust into which a grantor transfers appreciating assets while retaining the right to receive a fixed annuity payment for a term. At the end of the term, any remaining growth passes to beneficiaries with little or no additional gift tax.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Shifting future appreciation on volatile or high‑growth assets (e.g., pre‑IPO shares, concentrated stock, private business interests) to heirs at a low transfer tax cost.</li>
      <li>Leveraging low IRS §7520 rates to “freeze” asset values for estate tax purposes.</li>
      <li>Pairing with other trusts (e.g., sales to IDGT) to compound estate‑free transfers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Minimal gift tax when structured as a “zeroed‑out” GRAT—only the remainder interest is a taxable gift.</li>
      <li>Excess appreciation above the IRS hurdle rate passes to beneficiaries free of additional gift or estate tax.</li>
      <li>Can be rolled or “cascaded” to repeat the strategy with successive two–three‑year GRATs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If the grantor dies during the GRAT term, remaining assets revert to the estate and negate tax benefits.</li>
      <li>Requires accurate asset valuations and careful administration; subject to IRS scrutiny.</li>
      <li>Not suitable for assets expected to underperform the §7520 rate; the strategy can fail if returns are low.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Owners of concentrated stock positions or business interests anticipating liquidity events.</li>
      <li>Used with volatile assets (e.g., hedge fund GP interests) to exploit the spread between actual growth and the assumed IRS rate.</li>
      <li>Often implemented in multiple short‑term GRATs to mitigate mortality risk and capture upside.</li>
    </ul>
