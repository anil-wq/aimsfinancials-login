    <h2>Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>An irrevocable trust where the grantor transfers assets but retains a fixed annuity for a term; remainder passes to heirs if asset growth exceeds the IRS §7520 rate.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>Efficiently transfers appreciation with minimal gift tax when structured properly (zeroed-out GRATs).</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Shift post-transfer appreciation to heirs</li><li>Low gift tax if annuity equals initial value</li><li>Works well with volatile/high-growth assets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mortality risk if grantor dies during term (assets revert)</li><li>Requires strict annuity payments</li><li>Future legislative risk on serial short-term GRATs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>Using GRATs can remove significant appreciation from estates; not using them may forgo a relatively low-risk transfer strategy for growth assets.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Executives with pre-IPO or concentrated stock</li><li>HNW families running rolling 2–3 year GRAT ladders</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>Valuation and timing are critical; pair with sales or swaps to manage basis and cash flows.</p>
