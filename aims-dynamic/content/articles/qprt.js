    <h2>Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT)</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>Transfers a residence at discounted gift value while retaining use for a term.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>Removes appreciating real estate from the estate while maintaining occupancy.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Gift tax leverage via retained term</li><li>Estate reduction</li><li>Hedge against property appreciation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Estate inclusion if death during term</li><li>Post‑term rent required for continued use</li><li>Loss of full control</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>QPRT can materially lower estate tax; without it, home remains inside estate.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Primary/vacation homes in high‑growth markets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
