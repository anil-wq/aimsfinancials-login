    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A QPRT is an irrevocable trust that allows a homeowner to transfer a primary or vacation residence to beneficiaries at a reduced gift value while retaining the right to live in the home for a specified term. At the end of the term, ownership passes to the beneficiaries, and the residence is removed from the grantor’s estate.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Homeowners with valuable residences seeking to reduce estate and gift taxes while continuing to occupy the property.</li>
      <li>Estate‑planning strategies in low interest‑rate environments to maximize the discount on the transfer value.</li>
      <li>Part of a broader wealth‑transfer plan, often in conjunction with other trusts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduces estate taxes by freezing the value of the residence at the time of transfer【191962751544279†L170-L199】.</li>
      <li>Discounts the property’s value for gift‑tax purposes due to the grantor’s retained interest【191962751544279†L184-L188】.</li>
      <li>Allows the grantor to continue living in the home during the trust term and even afterwards by paying market rent【191962751544279†L190-L199】.</li>
      <li>The grantor can serve as trustee and maintain control over the residence during the trust term【191962751544279†L194-L201】.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The trust is irrevocable; terms cannot be changed once established【191962751544279†L208-L213】.</li>
      <li>If the grantor dies before the trust term ends, the property reverts to the estate and loses tax benefits【191962751544279†L213-L217】.</li>
      <li>Mortgage payments are treated as additional gifts, and the property cannot be refinanced without jeopardizing the trust【191962751544279†L219-L223】.</li>
      <li>The grantor remains responsible for property taxes and expenses during the term【191962751544279†L225-L227】.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>High‑net‑worth individuals with appreciating primary or vacation homes who want to remove future appreciation from their estate.</li>
      <li>Structured in conjunction with other trusts to control what happens after the QPRT term, such as pouring the home into a dynasty trust.</li>
      <li>Careful term selection is critical; longer terms provide bigger discounts but increase the risk of mortality before the term ends.</li>
    </ul>
