    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>
      A revocable living trust is a legal entity you create during your lifetime to
      hold and manage your assets. You retain control and can amend or revoke it
      at any time. Upon death, the trust dictates how assets are distributed.
    </p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Avoids probate, allowing assets to pass quickly and privately to heirs【386114534604544†L58-L72】.</li>
      <li> Maintains privacy because trust documents are not part of the public probate record【386114534604544†L58-L72】.</li>
      <li>
        Provides continuity of asset management if you become incapacitated by
        appointing a successor trustee【386114534604544†L74-L81】.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can help separate premarital or out‑of‑state property from community
        assets【386114534604544†L83-L89】.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Requires time and expense to set up and to retitle all assets into the
        trust【386114534604544†L93-L105】.
      </li>
      <li>
        Does not provide tax benefits; income and assets remain part of your
        taxable estate【386114534604544†L107-L115】.
      </li>
      <li>
        Offers little protection from creditors because you retain control【386114534604544†L117-L121】.
      </li>
      <li>
        Must be maintained; failure to fund or update the trust can result in
        probate【386114534604544†L136-L145】.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Useful for families owning real property in multiple states or with complex
        distribution plans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Often paired with pour‑over wills and durable powers of attorney to
        complete an estate plan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provides privacy but should be complemented by irrevocable trusts for tax
        and asset protection goals.
      </li>
    </ul>
