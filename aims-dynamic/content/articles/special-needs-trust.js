    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A special needs trust (also called a supplemental needs trust) is an irrevocable trust designed to provide for the extra and supplemental expenses of a person with disabilities without jeopardizing eligibility for government benefits such as Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income (SSI).</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Families who have a child or dependent with special needs and want to enhance their quality of life beyond what government benefits cover.</li>
      <li>Protecting settlements or inheritances for individuals with disabilities so they do not disqualify them from means‑tested programs.</li>
      <li>Coordinating long‑term care planning and future guardianship arrangements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Assets held in the trust are not counted as resources for Medicaid and SSI eligibility purposes.</li>
      <li>Trust funds can pay for education, therapies, transportation, personal care attendants and recreation to improve the beneficiary’s quality of life.</li>
      <li>Protects the beneficiary from financial abuse and mismanagement by appointing a reliable trustee.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Strict rules on permissible expenditures; improper distributions can jeopardize benefits.</li>
      <li>Requires competent trusteeship and legal drafting; ongoing administration costs.</li>
      <li>Irrevocable—once assets are contributed, they cannot be reclaimed by the grantor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Funding with life insurance or investments to provide lifetime support for a disabled child or relative.</li>
      <li>Integrating with broader estate planning, including pour‑over wills and guardianship arrangements.</li>
      <li>Ensuring that a beneficiary receives professional care and resources without endangering public assistance.</li>
    </ul>
