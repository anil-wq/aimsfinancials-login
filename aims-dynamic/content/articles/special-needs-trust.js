    <h2>Special Needs Trust</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Preserves SSI/Medicaid eligibility</li><li>Professional management for vulnerable beneficiaries</li><li>Customizable distributions for supplemental needs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Strict drafting and administration to avoid disqualification</li><li>Potential payback provisions (first-party SNT)</li><li>Limited beneficiary control</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
