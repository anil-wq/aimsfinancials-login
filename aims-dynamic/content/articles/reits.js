    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A real estate investment trust (REIT) owns, operates or finances income‑producing real estate. Public REITs trade on stock exchanges, while non‑traded REITs are privately offered. By law, REITs must distribute at least 90% of taxable income to shareholders, resulting in high dividend payouts.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Investors seeking exposure to real estate without the hassles of direct property ownership.</li>
      <li>Portfolios needing diversification and a potential inflation hedge.</li>
      <li>Income‑oriented strategies that value regular dividend payments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>High dividend yields due to the 90% payout requirement.</li>
      <li>Liquidity: publicly traded REIT shares can be bought or sold like stocks.</li>
      <li>Diversification across property types (e.g., offices, apartments, data centers) and geographic regions.</li>
      <li>Professional property management and access to large‑scale real estate projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Limited reinvestment of earnings restricts growth potential; share price may lag property value appreciation.</li>
      <li>Dividends are generally taxed as ordinary income; tax treatment can be less favorable than qualified dividends.</li>
      <li>Highly sensitive to interest‑rate changes and economic cycles; property sector downturns can reduce dividends.</li>
      <li>Non‑traded REITs may have high fees, limited liquidity and valuation transparency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Adding income and real‑asset exposure to diversified portfolios.</li>
      <li>Allocating to private or institutional real estate funds for greater control over leverage and diversification.</li>
      <li>Considering REITs in tax‑advantaged accounts to mitigate ordinary‑income taxation of dividends.</li>
    </ul>
