    <h2>REITs</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>Real Estate Investment Trusts own and operate income-producing real estate and must distribute most taxable income as dividends.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>Offer real estate exposure with liquidity and historically high dividend distributions compared with equities.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Diversification into real assets</li><li>High dividend payout requirements</li><li>Public REITs offer daily liquidity</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Dividends often taxed as ordinary income (partially QBI eligible)</li><li>Sector concentration risk</li><li>Interest rate sensitivity</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>Without REITs, portfolios may lack real asset exposure and income diversification.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>HNW investors blend public REITs with private real estate and opportunistic funds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
