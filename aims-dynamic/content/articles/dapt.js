    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A DAPT is a self‑settled irrevocable trust established in a jurisdiction that allows the grantor to remain a discretionary beneficiary while shielding trust assets from future creditors. Only certain U.S. states authorize these trusts.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Asset protection planning for professionals, business owners and others exposed to potential lawsuits.</li>
      <li>Safeguarding assets from future creditors while maintaining access (at the trustee’s discretion).</li>
      <li>Protecting assets in the event of divorce when properly established before marriage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Deters litigation and may encourage settlements due to increased difficulty of reaching trust assets.</li>
      <li>Offers a layer of protection against creditors’ claims and judgments, depending on jurisdiction.</li>
      <li>Allows the grantor to add or remove assets and benefit from trust distributions at the trustee’s discretion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Laws vary significantly by state; some courts or federal bankruptcy law may ignore the protection.</li>
      <li>No guarantee of privacy—trustees may be compelled by subpoena to provide information.</li>
      <li>High legal and administrative costs; may not protect assets from existing creditors or fraud claims.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Physicians, CEOs and entrepreneurs seeking to isolate personal assets from professional liability.</li>
      <li>Often used in conjunction with LLCs or limited partnerships to enhance protection.</li>
      <li>Should be established well in advance of any claims to avoid fraudulent‑transfer issues.</li>
    </ul>
