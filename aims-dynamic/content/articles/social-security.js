    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>
      Social Security is a federal program providing retirement, disability and
      survivor benefits funded primarily through payroll taxes. Benefits are
      calculated based on your earnings history and the age at which you claim.
    </p>

    <h3>Solvency &amp; risks</h3>
    <p>
      The program is not "going bankrupt," but the combined Old‑Age and
      Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability Insurance (DI) trust funds are
      projected to be depleted in 2034【443433705998405†L47-L59】. At that point,
      ongoing payroll taxes would fund about 81&nbsp;% of scheduled benefits
     【807899732412377†L71-L96】. This means benefits could be reduced if
      Congress does not enact reforms. Claims that the system will pay
      nothing are misleading.【807899732412377†L96-L105】.
    </p>

    <h3>Planning considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Delaying benefits increases your monthly payment; evaluate claiming
        strategies alongside other retirement income sources.
      </li>
      <li>
        Because benefits may be partially taxable and subject to potential
        future reductions, high‑net‑worth individuals should view Social
        Security as one pillar of retirement income, not the sole source.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue monitoring legislative changes and adjust your plan
        accordingly; bridging strategies (e.g., annuities, investments)
        may mitigate reduction risk.
      </li>
    </ul>
