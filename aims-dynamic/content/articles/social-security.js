    <h2>Social Security & Solvency</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Inflation-protected income</li><li>Spousal and survivor benefits</li><li>Progressive benefit formula aids lower earners</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Potential future solvency pressures of trust funds</li><li>Benefits may not cover all retirement needs for HNW clients</li><li>Taxation of benefits for higher-income households</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>Understanding Social Security claiming strategies is crucial; ignoring it can lead to suboptimal claiming and lost lifetime benefits.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
