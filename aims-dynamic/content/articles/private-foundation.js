    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A private foundation is a nonprofit entity funded and controlled by an individual, family or corporation. It makes grants to charitable organizations or operates its own programs. The foundation is subject to IRS rules, including a minimum annual distribution requirement and public reporting.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Donors who desire full control over investments, governance and grantmaking decisions.</li>
      <li>Long‑term charitable legacy planning with potential involvement of family members as board members or employees.</li>
      <li>Large philanthropic commitments that warrant the expense and administrative complexity of a standalone entity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Donor retains control over grant decisions, investments and charitable mission.</li>
      <li>Ability to hire family members and pay reasonable compensation for charitable work.</li>
      <li>Perpetual existence and potential to build a lasting philanthropic brand.</li>
      <li>Flexibility in charitable purposes, including making program‑related investments and international grants.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Significant start‑up and ongoing administrative costs (legal, accounting, staffing).</li>
      <li>Must distribute at least 5% of net assets annually; failure results in penalties.</li>
      <li>Subject to excise tax on net investment income and strict self‑dealing rules.</li>
      <li>Public reporting reduces privacy; donors receive lower income‑tax deduction limits compared with DAFs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ultra‑high‑net‑worth families seeking a platform for long‑term, large‑scale philanthropy and family engagement.</li>
      <li>Used when donors want to fund operating programs (e.g., scholarships, research) or make complex grants not available through DAFs.</li>
      <li>Can be paired with a DAF to maintain anonymity on certain grants while using the foundation for core giving.</li>
    </ul>
