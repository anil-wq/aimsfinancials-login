    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>
      A Roth 401(k) is an employer‑sponsored plan that combines features of a
      traditional 401(k) and a Roth IRA. You contribute after‑tax dollars
      through salary deferrals, and investment earnings grow tax free. In
      retirement qualified withdrawals of contributions and earnings are
      entirely tax free.
    </p>

    <h3>Key features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>After‑tax contributions.</strong> Contributions do not reduce
        current taxable income, but allow for tax‑free distributions later.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>High contribution limits.</strong> Because it is a 401(k), you
        can defer up to $23,000 (2024 limit) plus catch‑up contributions if
        over age 50, which is higher than IRA limits.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Employer match.</strong> Employer matching contributions go
        into a traditional 401(k) sub‑account and will be taxed when
        withdrawn.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Required minimum distributions.</strong> RMDs generally apply
        to Roth 401(k)s during the employee’s lifetime; however, you can
        roll a Roth 401(k) into a Roth IRA to avoid RMDs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Because contributions are after tax, you lose the immediate tax
        deduction of a traditional 401(k).
      </li>
      <li>
        Employers may not offer a Roth 401(k) option, or administrative
        complexity may limit investment choices.
      </li>
      <li>
        High earners expecting lower tax brackets in retirement may prefer
        pre‑tax deferrals; a blend of traditional and Roth contributions can
        create flexibility.
      </li>
    </ul>
