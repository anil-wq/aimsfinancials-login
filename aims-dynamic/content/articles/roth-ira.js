    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>
      A Roth IRA is an individual retirement account funded with after‑tax
      dollars. Contributions are not deductible, but qualified withdrawals in
      retirement are completely tax free. Because you’ve already paid taxes on
      contributions, growth and earnings can be withdrawn tax free if you meet
      certain rules.
    </p>

    <h3>Key features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Contribution limits.</strong> You can contribute up to $7,000
        annually ($8,000 if 50 or older) in 2024.
        Contributions must come from earned income and are subject to modified
        adjusted gross income (MAGI) phase‑outs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tax‑free growth &amp; distributions.</strong> Investment
        earnings grow tax free, and qualified withdrawals (after age 59½ and
        the account being at least five years old) are completely tax free.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No required minimum distributions.</strong> Unlike a
        traditional IRA, original account owners are not required to take
        distributions during their lifetime.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flexible withdrawals.</strong> Contributions (but not
        earnings) can be withdrawn at any time without tax or penalty,
        providing emergency liquidity.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Income limits restrict who can contribute directly; high earners
        may use a "backdoor" Roth conversion.
      </li>
      <li>
        After‑tax contributions mean you forgo an upfront deduction.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conversions from pre‑tax accounts create current income tax
        liability.
      </li>
    </ul>
