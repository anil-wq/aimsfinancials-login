    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>Municipal bonds are debt securities issued by state and local governments to finance public projects such as schools, roads and utilities. They include general obligation bonds, backed by the issuer’s taxing authority, and revenue bonds, supported by project revenue.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Investors seeking tax‑exempt income, particularly those in high tax brackets.</li>
      <li>Conservative allocations aiming for steady income with relatively low default risk.</li>
      <li>Creating laddered portfolios or managed accounts to match cash‑flow needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Interest income is generally exempt from federal income tax and may be exempt from state or local taxes for residents.</li>
      <li>Historically low default rates compared with corporate bonds; many are rated investment grade.</li>
      <li>Can be purchased individually or via mutual funds and ETFs for diversification and liquidity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lower yields than comparable taxable bonds; after‑tax advantage diminishes at lower tax brackets.</li>
      <li>Subject to credit risk if the issuer’s finances deteriorate and interest‑rate risk if rates rise.</li>
      <li>Some bonds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT) or affect Social Security taxation.</li>
      <li>Bond funds can lose principal value when interest rates increase; non‑traded bonds may be illiquid.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>High‑net‑worth investors use municipal bonds for tax‑efficient income and to diversify fixed‑income portfolios.</li>
      <li>Separately managed accounts can tailor credit quality, state exposure and maturity ladders.</li>
      <li>Consider the interplay with AMT and state tax benefits when constructing a portfolio.</li>
    </ul>
