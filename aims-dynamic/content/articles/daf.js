    <h2>Donor‑Advised Funds (DAFs)</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>DAFs are charitable accounts allowing immediate deductions with the ability to recommend grants over time.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>Used to bunch deductions in high-income years and to streamline giving.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Immediate deduction (subject to AGI limits)</li><li>Administrative simplicity vs foundations</li><li>Anonymous granting possible</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sponsor control over investments and grant approval</li><li>No binding legal control over assets post-gift</li><li>Deduction ceilings lower than some gifts to public charities</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>DAFs make giving easy and tax-efficient; without them, timing deductions may be difficult for irregular income years.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tech executives deferring grant decisions after liquidity events</li><li>Pair DAF with appreciated stock gifts to avoid capital gains</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>DAFs integrate with broader estate/charitable planning and can complement or precede private foundations.</p>
