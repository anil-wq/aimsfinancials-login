    <h2>Donor‑Advised Funds (DAFs)</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>Charitable accounts allowing immediate deduction and later grant recommendations.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>Great for bunching deductions in high‑income years and simple gifting of appreciated assets.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Immediate deduction subject to AGI limits</li><li>Low admin vs foundation</li><li>Anonymous grants possible</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sponsor controls investments/approvals</li><li>Irrevocable gifts; no legal control post‑gift</li><li>Deduction ceilings vs public charity gifts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>DAFs simplify strategic giving; without them, timing deductions can be hard around liquidity events.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tech execs donating appreciated stock/crypto pre‑liquidity</li><li>Pair DAF with QSBS or charitable stacking plans</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>Coordinate with estate documents to continue donor intent; can precede a foundation.</p>
