    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>
      A Life Insurance Retirement Plan (LIRP) is not a qualified retirement
      plan but a strategy that uses the cash value of a permanent life
      insurance policy to supplement retirement income. You pay premiums with
      after‑tax dollars and allow cash value to accumulate tax deferred. Later
      in retirement you can take loans or withdrawals against the cash value
      to generate tax‑advantaged income, while still maintaining a death
      benefit for heirs.
    </p>

    <h3>Key features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Premium flexibility.</strong> Policies such as variable and
        indexed universal life allow flexible premium payments and the ability
        to direct funds into subaccounts or indexed strategies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tax‑deferred growth.</strong> Cash value grows without
        current taxation; loans or withdrawals can be structured to be
        tax free if the policy stays in force.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Unlimited contributions.</strong> Unlike qualified plans, there
        are no statutory contribution limits, though policies must meet
        insurance guidelines to avoid Modified Endowment Contract (MEC)
        treatment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Additional benefits.</strong> Policies may include riders for
        long‑term care, chronic illness or other protections, and the death
        benefit can pass to heirs income tax free.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Costs can be high in early years due to mortality charges and policy
        expenses; careful design is needed to maximize efficiency.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the policy lapses or becomes a MEC, withdrawals or loans may be
        taxable and subject to penalties.
      </li>
      <li>
        LIRPs are generally best suited for high earners who have already
        maximized other tax‑advantaged savings and need additional
        accumulation or estate planning tools.
      </li>
    </ul>
