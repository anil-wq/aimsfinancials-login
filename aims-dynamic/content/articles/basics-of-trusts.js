    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>
      In simple terms, a trust is a legal arrangement where a person (the
      <strong>grantor</strong>) transfers legal title of property — the trust res or
      corpus — to a <strong>trustee</strong> to manage for the benefit of a
      <strong>beneficiary</strong>. The grantor sets out the terms in the trust
      instrument, and the trustee must follow those instructions when
      administering the trust【517492071183580†L64-L101】. The beneficiary holds
      beneficial title to the property but does not control the assets.
    </p>

    <h3>Key terms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Grantor / Settlor</strong> – the person who transfers property to the
        trustee. Also called the trustor or donor【517492071183580†L64-L81】.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Trust property (corpus)</strong> – the assets placed into the trust.
        A trust must have some assets, even if only a dollar. Trust property can
        include cash, securities, real estate, personal property and life
        insurance policies【517492071183580†L81-L87】.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Trustee</strong> – the individual or institution that holds legal
        title to the trust assets and has a fiduciary duty to manage them for
        the beneficiary. A trustee can be a corporate fiduciary or any
        competent individual and may be held personally liable for breaches of
        duty【517492071183580†L88-L96】.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Beneficiary</strong> – the person or entity that receives the
        benefits of the trust property. Beneficiaries hold beneficial title but
        do not manage the assets【517492071183580†L97-L101】.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Purpose</strong> – every trust must have a legal purpose. Examples
        include providing income for a beneficiary, delaying distributions until
        beneficiaries reach a certain age, or protecting assets from
        creditors【517492071183580†L119-L131】.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Common benefits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Trusts can give a beneficiary the income from property while preserving
        the property itself for a successor beneficiary【517492071183580†L119-L127】.
      </li>
      <li>
        The grantor can delay or stage distributions — for example, providing
        partial payments until the beneficiary reaches an age of majority or
        meets certain conditions【517492071183580†L120-L126】.
      </li>
      <li>
        Certain trusts, often called spendthrift trusts, protect assets from
        beneficiaries’ creditors by giving the trustee discretion to withhold
        payments【517492071183580†L127-L131】.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </>
