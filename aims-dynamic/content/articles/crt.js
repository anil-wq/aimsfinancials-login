    <h2>Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT)</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A split-interest trust providing an annuity or unitrust payout to non-charitable beneficiaries for a period, with remainder to charity.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Partial income tax deduction at funding</li><li>Tax deferral within trust until distributions</li><li>Income to donor/beneficiaries; remainder to charity</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Irrevocable; remainder must go to charity</li><li>Complex tiered income character rules</li><li>5% probability test and payout bounds apply</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
