    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A CRT is an irrevocable trust into which a donor transfers assets. The trust makes annual payments to the donor or other non‑charitable beneficiary for a term or lifetime. When the term ends, the remaining assets go to one or more charities.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Individuals with highly appreciated assets looking to diversify without triggering immediate capital gains tax.</li>
      <li>Philanthropists seeking a charitable legacy while retaining an income stream.</li>
      <li>Reducing estate and gift taxes by removing assets from the taxable estate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Provides a partial charitable income tax deduction when funded.</li>
      <li>Avoids or defers capital gains tax on the sale of contributed assets; the full value can be reinvested.</li>
      <li>Reduces estate and gift taxes by excluding assets and their appreciation from the estate.</li>
      <li>Delivers a steady income stream to the donor or another beneficiary for life or a term.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Irrevocable—the donor forfeits control over the assets once transferred to the CRT.</li>
      <li>Complex to establish and administer; annual valuation and tax filings required.</li>
      <li>Income payments depend on investment performance; the remainder passing to charity may be less than anticipated if returns are poor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Converting appreciated stock or real estate into diversified portfolios without paying immediate capital gains tax.</li>
      <li>Pairing with a wealth‑replacement trust (e.g., ILIT funded with life insurance) to replace the charitable remainder for heirs.</li>
      <li>Providing lifetime income to the donor while securing a charitable legacy and estate tax benefits.</li>
    </ul>
