    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>VUL is permanent life insurance that combines flexible premiums and death benefits with investment options. Policy cash values are allocated to subaccounts similar to mutual funds, exposing the policyholder to market gains and losses.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>For investors who want both life insurance and the potential for higher investment returns.</li>
      <li>To accumulate wealth tax‑deferred and access it through policy loans or withdrawals.</li>
      <li>When paired with an ILIT to provide estate‑tax liquidity with growth potential.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Highest long‑term growth potential among permanent policies through equity‑style subaccounts.</li>
      <li>Tax‑deferred accumulation of investment gains and the possibility of tax‑free distributions if managed properly.</li>
      <li>Flexibility to allocate among different investment options and adjust premiums and death benefit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Market risk—poor performance can deplete cash value and cause the policy to lapse unless additional premiums are paid.</li>
      <li>Higher fees than other policy types; requires active management of investments and periodic rebalancing.</li>
      <li>Loans and withdrawals reduce the death benefit and cash value; over‑loaning can create taxable events.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Paired with an ILIT to provide estate‑tax liquidity while pursuing long‑term investment growth.</li>
      <li>Private placement variants (PPLI) offer institutional pricing and bespoke investments for accredited investors.</li>
      <li>Appropriate for investors with high risk tolerance and long time horizons; requires regular monitoring.</li>
    </ul>
