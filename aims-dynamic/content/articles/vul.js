    <h2>Variable Universal Life (VUL)</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>Variable UL allocates cash value into subaccounts (similar to mutual funds). Policyholders assume investment risk and return and have greater upside potential.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>VUL is attractive for clients comfortable with investment volatility who want direct market exposure within a tax-advantaged wrapper.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>High upside potential tied to market subaccounts</li><li>Investment control and customization</li><li>Flexible premium structures</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Downside risk to cash value and potential for lapse</li><li>More regulatory complexity and required disclosures</li><li>Higher fees for investment management and insurance costs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>VUL can accelerate cash accumulation but carries market downside. Not having VUL limits tax-sheltered market exposure options.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>High-net-worth investors who want inside-baseball management of investments</li><li>Clients using VUL to complement other investment portfolios</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>VUL may be included in estate plans but requires careful monitoring and trust alignment to manage investment and tax outcomes.</p>
