    <h2>Power of Attorney</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A power of attorney (POA) appoints an agent to act on your behalf for financial and legal matters during incapacity.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>POAs avoid the need for court-appointed guardianship and permit quick action when someone is incapacitated.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Allows trusted agent to manage finances</li><li>Avoids court guardianship for routine matters</li><li>Customizable scope and duration</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Agent abuse risk if poorly drafted or if agent is untrustworthy</li><li>State law variations and execution formalities</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>Without a POA, families may face expensive and time-consuming court proceedings to appoint a guardian/agent.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Essential for HNW individuals to enable advisors/trustees to act quickly on bill-pay, investments, and tax matters</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>POAs should be coordinated with trustee appointments and successor decision-makers to avoid conflicts.</p>
