    <h2>Revocable Living Trust (Avoiding Probate)</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A revocable trust holds title to assets during life and enables successor management without probate.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoids probate for funded assets</li><li>Continuity during incapacity</li><li>Private vs public court records</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Requires proper funding/retitling</li><li>No creditor/tax protection while revocable</li><li>Ongoing trustee duties</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>Funded RLTs avoid delays and publicity; unfunded trusts fail to deliver benefits.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Families wanting seamless transition and privacy</li><li>Pair with pour‑over will and POAs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>RLTs are the foundation; layer ILIT/IDGT/GRAT for tax/asset protection as needed.</p>
