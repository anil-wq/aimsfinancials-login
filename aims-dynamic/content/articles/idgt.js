    <h2>Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT)</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>An irrevocable trust treated as a grantor trust for income tax (grantor pays tax) but excluded from the grantor’s estate for transfer tax.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>Allows assets to grow outside the estate while the grantor’s tax payments further reduce the estate (a tax-free additional gift).</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Estate freeze by selling assets for a note</li><li>Grantor’s tax payments are not gifts</li><li>Flexible design for income and control via trustee</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Complex drafting and ongoing administration</li><li>IRS scrutiny of valuations and terms</li><li>Requires liquidity to service note payments</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>An IDGT can shift large appreciation out of the estate; without it, estate tax exposure on growth assets may remain high.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sale of closely held business interests, LP/LLC interests, or marketable securities to IDGT</li><li>Combining with GRATs and ILITs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>Installment sale terms (interest rate AFR) and valuation discounts are key; observe seed gift requirements and formalities.</p>
