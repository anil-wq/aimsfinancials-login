    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>An IDGT is an irrevocable trust that is “defective” for income tax purposes (the grantor is treated as owner) but effective for estate and gift tax purposes. The grantor sells or gifts assets to the trust; the assets and future appreciation are removed from the estate, while the grantor continues to pay income taxes on the trust income.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Transferring appreciating or income‑generating assets to heirs while using little or no gift tax exemption.</li>
      <li>Freezing the value of assets in the grantor’s estate and shifting future growth out of the taxable estate.</li>
      <li>Combining with promissory notes or installment sales to leverage low interest rates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Future appreciation escapes estate taxation if assets outperform the interest rate on any note.</li>
      <li>The grantor’s payment of the trust’s income tax effectively makes additional, tax‑free gifts to beneficiaries.</li>
      <li>Greater asset protection than outright transfers, depending on trust provisions and jurisdiction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Irrevocable—loss of control over transferred assets; cannot be amended or revoked.</li>
      <li>Grantor must continue paying income tax on trust income, potentially creating cash‑flow strain if assets do not generate sufficient income.</li>
      <li>No step‑up in basis at the grantor’s death; beneficiaries inherit the original tax basis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Gifting family business shares, real estate or private equity interests expected to appreciate at high rates.</li>
      <li>Pairing with a GRAT or CLT for comprehensive estate‑freeze strategies.</li>
      <li>Using a note sale to the IDGT to remove additional value while locking in historically low interest rates.</li>
    </ul>
