    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>
      An irrevocable trust is a legal arrangement in which you permanently transfer
      ownership of assets to a trustee. Unlike a revocable trust, once it is
      established you generally cannot change or dissolve it without the
      beneficiary’s consent or a court order. Because the assets no longer
      belong to you, they are removed from your taxable estate and may be
      protected from future creditors.
    </p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Removes assets from your estate, which can reduce estate taxes and
        shelter appreciation from future transfer tax【820118204843693†L83-L99】.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provides asset protection; because you relinquish control, creditors
        generally cannot reach the trust corpus【820118204843693†L83-L99】.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allows you to set terms for how and when beneficiaries receive assets,
        helping ensure wealth is managed responsibly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can be designed to purchase and hold life insurance outside of your
        estate (e.g., an ILIT) or to make charitable gifts while retaining
        income (CRT/CLT).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You generally cannot change the terms or reclaim the assets once the
        trust is executed, limiting flexibility【820118204843693†L59-L112】.
      </li>
      <li>
        Professional trustee fees and ongoing administration may be required
        depending on the trust structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gifts to an irrevocable trust use up lifetime gift and estate tax
        exemption and may have gift tax consequences.
      </li>
      <li>
        Depending on the trust type, income may be taxed at compressed trust
        tax brackets if not distributed to beneficiaries.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Useful for high‑net‑worth families seeking estate tax reduction,
        creditor protection or to leverage discounting techniques (e.g., GRATs,
        IDGTs) within the irrevocable structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Often combined with life insurance (ILIT) to provide liquidity for
        estate taxes and equalization among heirs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Because of the permanence, careful planning and coordination with legal
        counsel is essential.
      </li>
