    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>Whole life is permanent insurance that combines guaranteed premiums, a fixed death benefit and a contractually guaranteed cash‑value schedule. Participating policies may pay dividends that increase both the cash value and death benefit.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Long‑term estate planning and liquidity needs where guarantees are paramount.</li>
      <li>A conservative component of a private balance sheet, serving as a "bond proxy" with tax‑advantaged growth.</li>
      <li>Supplemental retirement funding through policy loans or withdrawals of basis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Guarantees on premiums, death benefit and minimum cash‑value accumulation.</li>
      <li>Eligibility for dividends (on participating policies) can accelerate growth through paid‑up additions.</li>
      <li>Policy loans provide tax‑advantaged access to cash value without surrendering the policy, if managed prudently.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Higher premiums than term or universal life; early surrender charges and slower cash‑value growth in the early years.</li>
      <li>Less flexibility to adjust premiums or coverage amounts once the policy is issued.</li>
      <li>Dividends are not guaranteed and depend on insurer performance; over‑funding may trigger modified endowment contract (MEC) status.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Owned inside an ILIT to provide estate‑tax liquidity and asset protection.</li>
      <li>Used as a stable, tax‑advantaged asset in high‑net‑worth portfolios; functions as a cash reserve with guaranteed returns.</li>
      <li>Can be financed through premium‑financing arrangements to leverage low interest rates, with appropriate stress‑testing.</li>
    </ul>
