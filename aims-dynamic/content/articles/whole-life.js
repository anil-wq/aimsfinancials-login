    <h2>Whole Life Insurance</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>Whole life is a permanent life insurance contract providing level premiums, a guaranteed death benefit, and a cash value component that grows at a rate declared by the insurer (dividends for mutual insurers).</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>Used for long-term guaranteed protection and conservative cash-value accumulation with predictable features.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Guaranteed death benefit (if premiums paid)</li><li>Stable, conservative cash value growth</li><li>Dividends (when declared) can enhance returns</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>High initial cost vs term</li><li>Limited flexibility on premium patterns and policy changes</li><li>Lower early cash value growth due to higher initial expenses</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>Including whole life in a plan can provide highly reliable death benefit guarantees. Omitting it means relying on other sources for permanent guarantees which may increase estate risk.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Legacy planning where guarantees and predictable payouts are essential</li><li>Supplemental conservative savings for wealthy clients who value guarantees</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>Whole life can be held in an ILIT for estate tax protection; however its lack of premium flexibility may limit tactical estate maneuvers.</p>
