    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>Private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) invest in non‑public companies. PE firms typically buy mature businesses and work to improve operations before exiting via sale or IPO. VC firms invest in early‑stage companies with high growth potential. Investments are made through funds with long lock‑up periods.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Diversifying a portfolio beyond public markets and targeting higher return potential.</li>
      <li>Investors with sufficient net worth and liquidity who can commit capital for 7–10+ years.</li>
      <li>Accessing opportunities in innovation, technology, healthcare and other growth sectors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Potential for superior returns relative to public equities, especially with top‑quartile managers.</li>
      <li>Active ownership can create operational improvements and strategic value.</li>
      <li>Diversification benefits due to low correlation with public markets and ability to access niche opportunities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Illiquidity—capital is committed for long periods and cannot be easily redeemed.</li>
      <li>High minimum investments and significant management and performance fees.</li>
      <li>Returns depend heavily on manager selection and market cycles; losses can be total if companies fail.</li>
      <li>Valuations are less transparent and rely on infrequent appraisals; reported returns may lag actual performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Allocating a portion of alternative investments to PE/VC funds or co‑investments to enhance returns.</li>
      <li>Diversifying across vintages, strategies (buyout, growth, venture) and geographies to manage risk.</li>
      <li>Utilising estate planning strategies, such as gifts or sales of limited partnership interests, to transfer appreciation to heirs.</li>
    </ul>
