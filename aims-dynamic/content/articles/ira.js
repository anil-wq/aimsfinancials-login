    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>
      A traditional Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) is a tax‑advantaged
      account you open on your own to save for retirement. You contribute
      pre‑tax or after‑tax dollars up to an annual limit, and investments grow
      tax deferred. Withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income.
    </p>

    <h3>Key features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Contribution limits.</strong> For 2024 the maximum contribution
        is $7,000 ($8,000 if age 50 or older)【284940355633267†L304-L347】. You
        must have earned income at least equal to the amount contributed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Deductibility.</strong> Contributions may be fully or partially
        deductible depending on your income and whether you or your spouse are
        covered by a workplace retirement plan【284940355633267†L304-L347】.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tax deferral.</strong> Investments grow tax deferred; you pay
        no tax until you take distributions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Required minimum distributions (RMDs).</strong> Distributions
        must begin by age 73 (for those turning 73 in 2024); RMDs ensure taxes
        are eventually collected【284940355633267†L304-L347】.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Withdrawals before age 59½ may be subject to a 10% penalty plus income
        tax, with exceptions for certain expenses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Contributions may be limited if your modified adjusted gross income
        exceeds certain thresholds when participating in an employer plan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conversions to a Roth IRA are permitted; taxes are owed on the
        pre‑tax portion at the time of conversion.
      </li>
    </ul>
