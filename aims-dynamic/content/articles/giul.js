    <h2>Guaranteed Indexed Universal Life (GIUL)</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>GIUL is a UL variant that emphasizes stronger guaranteed interest-crediting constructs and often simpler index mechanisms to prioritize long-term guarantee of the death benefit.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>GIUL is for clients who want index-style crediting but need more explicit long-run guarantees on the policyâ€™s core functions.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Long-duration guarantees when illustrated correctly</li><li>Simpler crediting models reduce structural surprises</li><li>Good for conservative growth with protection</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>More constrained upside due to conservative caps/spreads</li><li>Guaranteed designs may restrict later changes</li><li>May require disciplined funding to maintain guarantees</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>GIUL provides a middle ground for conservative clients seeking growth with safety. Without GIUL, achieving similar guarantees may require higher-cost strategies.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Clients who need strong death benefit guarantees with modest indexed participation</li><li>Estate planners wanting predictable outcomes tied to index credits</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>GIUL works well in ILIT and other trust frameworks when guarantees and predictability are high priorities.</p>
