    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>An annuity is a contract with an insurance company under which an investor pays premiums (either lump sum or periodic) in exchange for tax‑deferred growth and a future stream of income. Types include fixed (guaranteed rate), indexed (interest linked to an index with floors and caps) and variable (invested in subaccounts with market exposure).</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Securing lifetime or period‑certain income in retirement as part of a diversified plan.</li>
      <li>Deferring taxes on investment gains in non‑qualified accounts.</li>
      <li>Providing principal protection (fixed and indexed annuities) while retaining some upside.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tax‑deferred growth; earnings accumulate without current taxation until withdrawn.</li>
      <li>Option to annuitize and receive guaranteed income for life or a specified term.</li>
      <li>Death benefits and optional riders can provide guarantees for beneficiaries or long‑term care coverage.</li>
      <li>Indexed and variable annuities offer participation in market growth (subject to caps or subaccount performance).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>High fees including mortality and expense charges, administrative costs and rider premiums.</li>
      <li>Surrender charges and limited liquidity if funds are withdrawn early.</li>
      <li>Complex structures make it difficult to understand costs, crediting formulas and tax treatment.</li>
      <li>Variable annuities expose investors to market risk; index caps may limit participation in strong markets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating a floor of guaranteed income to cover essential expenses, allowing the rest of the portfolio to pursue growth.</li>
      <li>Using deferred or immediate annuities to hedge longevity risk and provide predictable cash flow.</li>
      <li>Structured as charitable gift annuities or in conjunction with trusts for philanthropic or estate planning purposes.</li>
    </ul>
