    <h2>General Partnership (GP)</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A general partnership is a business arrangement where partners share management responsibilities and liability.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>GPs can be used for family business operations or pooling resources with shared control.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Direct control for partners</li><li>Simplicity in formation</li><li>Flexible allocation of duties</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Unlimited liability for general partners</li><li>Difficult to pass control without planning</li><li>Not ideal for asset protection</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>GPs require careful succession planning to avoid loss of managerial continuity; without structure, family disputes can disrupt operations.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Used within family offices or closely held businesses where active management remains with partners</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>GP interests can be gifted or transitioned to trusts; valuation discounts may help move economic interests while retaining control.</p>
