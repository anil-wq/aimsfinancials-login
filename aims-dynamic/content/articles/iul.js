    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>An IUL is a form of universal life insurance with flexible premiums and death benefits. Interest credited to the policy’s cash value is linked to one or more market indexes (such as the S&amp;P 500) with a cap on upside and a floor (often 0%) to prevent negative returns.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Supplemental tax‑advantaged accumulation for retirement or legacy planning.</li>
      <li>For individuals seeking downside protection with some equity‑linked upside.</li>
      <li>Executive benefit plans and long‑term wealth‑transfer strategies when paired with an ILIT.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Downside floor protects against market losses; indexed crediting allows participation in market upside subject to caps.</li>
      <li>Flexible premiums and death benefits can be adjusted over time to meet changing needs.</li>
      <li>Policy loans and withdrawals provide tax‑advantaged access to cash value when managed properly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Caps and participation rates on index crediting can be reset by the insurer; illustrated values are not guaranteed.</li>
      <li>Cost of insurance charges increase with age; underfunding can cause the policy to lapse.</li>
      <li>Complex mechanics require careful monitoring and annual reviews; over‑loaning can cause tax consequences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Executive accumulation strategies where the death benefit is incidental but tax‑free distributions are desired.</li>
      <li>Estate planning through ILIT ownership to remove the death benefit from the taxable estate.</li>
      <li>Premium‑financing strategies when stress‑tested for interest‑rate and policy performance risk.</li>
    </ul>
