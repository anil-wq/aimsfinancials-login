    <h2>Indexed Universal Life (IUL)</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>IUL credits interest to the policy's cash value based on the performance of a market index (e.g., S&P 500) subject to a floor (commonly 0%) and a cap or participation rate.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>IUL appeals to those seeking market-linked upside with downside protection (floor), combining growth potential with some guarantees.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Index-linked upside with downside floor</li><li>Flexible premiums and potential for strong cash accumulation</li><li>Commonly used as a tax-advantaged accumulation vehicle (LIRP)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Caps, spreads and participation rates limit upside</li><li>Complex illustrations and sensitivity to crediting methods</li><li>Potential for underperformance vs direct market exposure</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>IUL can significantly enhance long-term cash accumulation opportunities with downside protection. Without it, clients may accept either pure market exposure (with no guarantees) or conservative returns.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Executives using IUL as part of a retirement-income ladder</li><li>High-net-worth clients seeking tax-advantaged cash value with downside protection</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>IUL can be paired with an ILIT or held personally; consider estate inclusion and trust titling depending on objectives.</p>
