    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>
      Survivorship (second‑to‑die) policies insure two lives and pay a single death
      benefit after both insureds have passed away. They are usually structured as
      permanent life insurance (whole or universal) to guarantee the benefit.
    </p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Estate liquidity: provides funds to pay estate taxes and settlement costs when
        the second spouse dies, preserving family wealth【17135836090882†L675-L723】.
      </li>
      <li>
        Special needs or dependent support: ensures care for a child or beneficiary who
        will require lifelong assistance【17135836090882†L675-L723】.
      </li>
      <li>
        Business succession or charitable legacies: funds buy‑sell agreements or
        endowments.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Less expensive than buying two separate permanent policies【17135836090882†L745-L770】.</li>
      <li>
        Underwriting on both lives can make it easier to qualify if one spouse has
        health issues【17135836090882†L675-L723】.
      </li>
      <li>
        Couples can leverage one policy to address estate and charitable planning
        goals.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Policy does not pay until both insureds have died; the surviving spouse must
        self‑fund expenses until then.
      </li>
      <li>Permanent coverage can be costly relative to term insurance【17135836090882†L772-L799】.</li>
      <li>
        Complexities during divorce or remarriage can make policy ownership and
        beneficiary design challenging【17135836090882†L772-L799】.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Often owned by an ILIT to keep proceeds outside the taxable estate and fund
        estate taxes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can be paired with charitable remainder or lead trusts to amplify
        philanthropic impact.
      </li>
