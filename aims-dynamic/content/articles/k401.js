    <h3>What it is</h3>

    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Plan rules and investment menus limit options</li><li>Nondiscrimination rules may affect high earners</li><li>Distributions taxed as ordinary income unless Roth</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>401(k) is a core retirement account for employees; missing it reduces retirement savings potential and employer match.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>

    </ul>
