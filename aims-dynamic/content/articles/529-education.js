    <h2>529 Plans & Education Trusts</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Tax-free qualified withdrawals</li><li>High aggregate contribution capacity with gift tax strategies</li><li>Portability and beneficiary changes allowed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Non-qualified withdrawals incur tax/penalty on earnings</li><li>Investment menu constraints</li><li>State-specific rules and benefits vary</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>Proactive education funding can reduce future cash flow stress; skipping it may mean higher after-tax costs later.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
