    <h2>Will (Why It Matters)</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A will is a legal document directing distribution of assets and naming guardians for minor children upon death.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>A will is the foundational estate document to avoid intestacy and to name guardianship and personal representatives.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Directs asset distribution</li><li>Names guardians for minors</li><li>Simplifies some administrative tasks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Subject to probate (public and potentially slow)</li><li>Without a will, intestacy rules apply which may not match intent</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>Without a will, courts decide guardianship and distribution which can create delays, costs and outcomes inconsistent with your wishes.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Essential for parents of minors to nominate guardians</li><li>Important for complex family situations where default intestacy would be unfair</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>A will alone often isn't sufficient for HNW estates; trusts and other tools are usually combined.</p>
