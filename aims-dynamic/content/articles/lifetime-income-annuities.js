    <h2>Lifetime Income Annuities (Private Pension)</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>Lifetime income annuities convert a lump sum into guaranteed periodic payments for life, similar to a private pension.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Guaranteed income for life</li><li>Simplicity and predictability</li><li>Various optional riders (inflation, joint life)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Irrevocable once annuitized</li><li>Potentially poor legacy value if the annuitant dies early</li><li>Limited liquidity</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>Lifetime annuities create a durable income floor; not having them means relying more on portfolio withdrawals which can be volatile.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>HNW clients allocate a portion of their portfolio to annuities to secure essential spending</li><li>Corporate pension buyouts or personal pension solutions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>Annuities often are excluded from probate and transfer by beneficiary designation in some structures; consider tax and legacy trade-offs.</p>
