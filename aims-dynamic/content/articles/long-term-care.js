    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>
      Long‑term care (LTC) refers to assistance with medical or personal needs
      for an extended period. It includes help with activities of daily
      living such as bathing, dressing and eating, whether provided at home,
      in assisted living or in a nursing facility. Around 70&nbsp;% of people
      turning 65 will need some form of long‑term care.
    </p>

    <h3>Why plan for LTC?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Health insurance and Medicare generally do not cover custodial long‑term
        care. Without planning, costs can erode
        retirement savings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Having coverage allows you to choose where and how you receive care
        (home vs facility) and helps protect heirs from financial burden
        .
      </li>
      <li>
        Purchasing LTC insurance in your 50s or early 60s may lock in
        affordable premiums and ensure insurability.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of coverage</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Traditional LTC insurance.</strong> Pays a daily or monthly
        benefit for covered care. Premiums may increase and the policy may be
        use‑it‑or‑lose‑it if you never need care.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hybrid or linked policies.</strong> Combine life insurance or
        annuities with LTC benefits; if care isn’t needed, your heirs receive
        a death benefit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Life policies with LTC riders.</strong> Universal life or whole
        life policies can include riders that accelerate the death benefit to
        pay for qualified LTC expenses.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Evaluate elimination periods, benefit amounts, inflation riders and
        coverage length when comparing policies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Premiums are based on age and health; lock in coverage before health
        declines.
      </li>
      <li>
        Self‑funding through dedicated savings or investing is an alternative,
        but earmarking assets specifically for LTC is important to avoid
        jeopardizing other goals.
      </li>
    </ul>
