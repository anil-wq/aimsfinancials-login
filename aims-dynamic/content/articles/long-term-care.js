    <h2>Long-Term Care Planning</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>Long-term care (LTC) planning prepares for needs like assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) over extended periods, either via insurance or self-funding.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>LTC planning protects assets and income against the potentially catastrophic costs of extended care.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Protects against asset erosion</li><li>Insures against longevity-related health costs</li><li>Hybrid policies can combine LTC with life insurance benefits</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Insurance costs can be high and underwriting strict for older clients</li><li>Self-insuring requires large liquid reserves</li><li>Policy complexity and inflation risk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>Without LTC planning, long care costs can rapidly deplete retirement assets and create family burden.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>HNW clients use hybrid life/LTC policies or captive strategies to preserve legacy assets</li><li>Trusts can be used to coordinate benefit eligibility and payment flows</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>LTC planning should be integrated with estate planning to preserve legacy and coordinate Medicaid privateness when appropriate.</p>
