    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A testamentary trust is created under a will and becomes effective only upon the grantor’s death. The will directs certain assets, including life insurance proceeds, into the trust during probate. The appointed trustee manages and distributes assets according to the instructions set forth in the will.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing oversight and staged distributions for minor children or beneficiaries who may need guidance.</li>
      <li>Ensuring assets are managed by a trusted individual until beneficiaries reach certain ages or milestones.</li>
      <li>When a revocable living trust is not needed or too costly; testamentary trusts can be a lower‑cost alternative.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Can be modified through the will while the testator is alive, offering flexibility in planning.</li>
      <li>Allows parents to direct when and how children receive inheritances, such as at certain ages or for specific purposes.</li>
      <li>Less expensive to create than a full living trust; funded only if the will is admitted to probate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Assets must go through probate before funding the trust, causing delays and additional costs.</li>
      <li>The will and trust become public record, reducing privacy.</li>
      <li>Because the trust is irrevocable after death, mis‑drafted instructions or poor trustee choices cannot be corrected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Holding life insurance proceeds for the benefit of minor children until a specified age.</li>
      <li>Combining with marital/credit‑shelter provisions in a will to maximize estate‑tax exemptions.</li>
      <li>Used when costs or complexity of a revocable trust are unwarranted, or where probate is acceptable.</li>
    </ul>
