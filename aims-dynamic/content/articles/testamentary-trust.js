    <h2>Testamentary Trust</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>A trust created under a will, springing into existence at death to control distributions and management for beneficiaries.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>Provides post-death control and protection for minors or spendthrift heirs without lifetime trust maintenance.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Court supervision may provide oversight</li><li>Customizable terms for distributions</li><li>Useful where probate is acceptable or required</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Still subject to probate because created by will</li><li>Less privacy than revocable trusts</li><li>Ongoing court reporting may add costs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>Testamentary trusts provide control where revocable trust structures were not used; without them, outright bequests may be mismanaged.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Blended families using testamentary trusts to balance competing interests</li><li>Guardianship trusts for minors</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>Should be coordinated with will provisions, guardianships, and tax planning for estate size.</p>
