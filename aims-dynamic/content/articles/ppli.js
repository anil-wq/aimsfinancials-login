    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>PPLI is a custom variable life policy offered to accredited investors and qualified purchasers. It combines a death benefit with an individually managed separate account that can hold hedge funds, private credit or other alternative investments. Fees are significantly lower than retail variable policies.</p>

    <h3>Where it fits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>High‑net‑worth investors seeking to wrap tax‑inefficient strategies in a tax‑advantaged insurance chassis.</li>
      <li>Long‑term wealth‑transfer planning when paired with an ILIT to keep the policy outside the taxable estate.</li>
      <li>Families desiring bespoke investment allocations and confidentiality not available in retail products.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Institutional fee structure compared with retail variable policies; access to alternative investment managers.</li>
      <li>Tax‑deferred growth of investments and tax‑free death benefit when structured properly.</li>
      <li>Ability to invest in customized strategies (hedge funds, private equity, SMAs) within the policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages / Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Restricted to accredited investors and subject to high minimum premiums.</li>
      <li>Complex regulatory requirements; must satisfy investor‑control and diversification rules to maintain tax status.</li>
      <li>Illiquidity and long time horizon; charges and early surrender penalties may apply.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HNW use‑cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Dynastic wealth planning when coupled with an ILIT in favorable jurisdictions (e.g., South Dakota).</li>
      <li>Wrapping hedge, credit or other high‑turnover strategies to eliminate annual income taxation.</li>
      <li>Leveraging premium financing to conserve capital while funding the policy.</li>
    </ul>
