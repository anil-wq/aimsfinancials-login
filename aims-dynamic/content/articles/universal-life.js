    <h2>Universal Life (UL) Overview</h2>
    <h3>What it is</h3>
    <p>Universal life is a flexible permanent policy where premiums, death benefit and cash value interact. UL policies can be structured to emphasize guarantees or growth depending on crediting options and riders.</p>

    <h3>Why someone needs it</h3>
    <p>UL offers design flexibility not available in whole lifeâ€”useful for custom funding, overfunding for cash accumulation, and riders for long-term planning.</p>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Flexible premium payments</li><li>Ability to overfund and take premium holidays</li><li>Multiple crediting options (fixed, indexed, market)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages & Risks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Complex product mechanics</li><li>Performance sensitive to crediting rates/market returns</li><li>Policy lapse risk if not monitored</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact of having it (or not)</h3>
    <p>Having UL offers versatile tools for wealth accumulation and tax-efficient access. Not having UL limits flexible planning alternatives for funding strategies.</p>

    <h3>High-net-worth use cases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use UL for supplemental retirement income (LIRP), estate liquidity with flexible premium timing, or dynamic cash value accumulation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Estate planning perspective</h3>
    <p>UL is commonly used within life insurance trust structures; careful drafting is required to achieve estate/transfer goals.</p>
